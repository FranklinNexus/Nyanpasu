⏰ Auto-Refresh
Wake up to a fresh look every day with the scheduled background updater:

## 📊 ASO (App Store Optimization) Tips

❌ **Bad**: "Wallpaper"
- Too generic
- Hard to find

### Description Strategy
1. **First 2 lines are critical** (visible before "Read More")
   - Lead with unique value: "Dual-Stream engine"
   - Mention mascot for personality
2. **Use emojis sparingly** (for visual breaks, not spam)
3. **Keyword placement**:
   - "anime wallpaper" appears 4 times
   - "dual-stream" appears 3 times
   - Long-tail keywords: "daily anime wallpaper", "lock screen wallpaper"

### Screenshot Captions
Add text overlays to screenshots:
1. "Dual Wallpaper Mode - Pink for Sync, Blue for Independent"
2. "200+ Mascot Quotes - Your Cute Companion"
3. "Smart Tags - Strict or Soft Mode"
4. "WYSIWYG Editor - Pan, Zoom, Crop"
5. "Porcelain White Design - Clean & Minimalist"
